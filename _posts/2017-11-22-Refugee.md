## Understanding U.S. Refugee Populations 

Lately I've been very interested in doing analytics and research on immigration. I was able to speak with a representative of the IRC, the international rescue commitee and I'm trying to understand underlying issues at hand with the U.S. and world at large.

There are a lot of resources out there and data that is public, I chose to explore the UNHCR database 

[Here](https://github.com/cwczarnik/Refugee_Study) is a link to my github repository with a bunch of data and already processed analytics.

It's an ongoing project and I'm hoping to build up a base of understanding for myself and others to work to understand global trends.
